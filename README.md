# hello-world
My first Github Repository!
I am a business student trying to learn more about things that I feel like my brother (who is in computer science) or engineers would learn about, and branch away from the typical or usual ideas about what a "business" student should know
This is the first step in trying to create a portfolio of original work and make some very cool things to put here for myself and others to see :)
